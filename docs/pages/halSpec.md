## Description

TV Settings HAL is an abstract layer, which provides APIs to Modify/Control the Picture quality parameters, dimming modes and auto backlight modes.

TvSettings-hal initialize the HAL API's with picture quality modes for specific platforms and initiates communication with Picture Quality drivers.

# Component Runtime Execution Requirements

SOC is responsible for handling the PQ settings at the end device as per the request from application via TV Settings HAL.
RDK Middleware has to monitor the response continuosly from the drivers upon requesting a settings change in TV. Failure to meet these requirements will likely result in tvError_t messages.

## Initialization and Startup

TvSettings HAL API will be initialized by ControlSettings Thunder plugin. RDK-V middleware expected to have complete control over the life cycle over the TV Settings HAL module.
TVSettings HAL is used by FactoryHal and MHal for White balancing purpose. ControlSettings Thunder plugin will first initialize by setting all the Picture Quality parameters 
 1. Initialize the TV Settings HAL using the function: tvInit (int *) before configuring any parameters using get/set functions. 
 2. The TV Settings HAL will set all the Picture Quality parameters for different content format and picture modes from the tvsettings.ini file as part of initialization. The file allmodes.conf decides the supported formats, picture modes, dimming modes, resolution etc.,
 3. We can then configure the Picture Quality parameters such as Brightness, Contrast, Hue, ColorTemp, RGB Gain values etc., for different Picture Quality modes using the get/set functions.
 4. We can also reset the parameters to the default value(set by config file) using the reset functions.
 5. Once the required Picture Quality params are configured, we can terminate the TV Settings HAL instace using tvTerm().

Need to call the function sequence in above order so that the system behaves
in a deterministic manner, every time.

## Threading Model

There is no requirement for the interface to be thread safe.

## Process Model

TV ControlSettings Thunder plugin will take care of Initializing TV Settings HAL component. At any point of time a single instance of TVMgr will exist to respond to any requests to configure the Picture Quality parameters from application.

## Memory Model

The TV settings HAL is handling the pointers in heap memory for each of the parameters to be set/get. 
For asynchronous updates, HAL will pass message buffer in the callback and client is responsible to copy to its internal buffer before callback is returned.

## Power Management Requirements

TV Settings HAL does participate in power management. It will cooperate with the Picture Quality Video Drivers for adjusting the Soc Picture Quality settings according to the power mode set.

## Asynchronous Notification Model

Change in data update can be done asynchronously with the following APIâ€™s.
  1. For Updating Video Format change, use this function: RegisterVideoFormatChangeCB(tvVideoFormatCallbackData& cbData)

  2. For updating the Video Resolution change, use this function : RegisterVideoResolutionChangeCB(tvVideoResolutionCallbackData& cbData)

  3.  For updating the video Frame Rate, use this function: RegisterVideoFrameRateChangeCB(tvVideoFrameRateCallbackData& cbData)


## Blocking calls

There are no blocking calls in TV Settings HAL

## Internal Error Handling

All the TV Settings HAL API should return error synchronously as a return argument from any of the types. HAL is responsible to handle system errors(e.g. out of memory) internally.

## Persistence Model

TV Settings HAL will initialize the HAL with the parameters present in GENERIC_MODE_CONFIG_FILE(tvsettings.ini) file name.

The default PQ parameters are kept as a persistent data to set during initialization.
Every OEM vendor has to define the tvsettings.ini file name and allmodes.conf file name in OEM layer.

# Nonfunctional requirements

Following non functional requirement should be supported by the TV Settings HAL component.

## Logging and debugging requirements

TV Settings HAL component should log all the error and critical informative messages which helps to debug/triage the issues and understand the functional flow of the system.

## Memory and performance requirements

Make sure TV Settings HAL is not contributing more to memory and CPU utilization while handling different scenarios of Picture Quality settings.

## Quality Control

There should not be any memory leaks/corruption introduced by HAL and underneath SOC software. TVSettings HAL should pass coverity scan verification periodically without any issue.
It should also pass Black duck, CMF approval, copyright checks.

## Licensing

TV Settings HAL implementation is expected to get released under the Apache License. 

## Build Requirements

TV Settings HAL source code should be build under Linux Yocto environment and should be delivered as a shared library.
  
## Variability Management

Any new API introduced should be implemented by all SOC vendor and RDK generic code will be compatible with specific version of TV Settings HAL software.

## Platform or Product Customization

Product or platform specific requirements can be handled in TV Settings HAL API and the Specifications for respective product can be modified in config file.

# Interface API Documentation

Using below mentioned steps Doxygen documentation can be generated
1. Run generate_docs.sh located at rdk-components-hal-tvsettings/docs
2. Go to rdk-components-hal-tvsettings/docs/output/html
3. index.html will show the documentation

## Theory of operation and key concepts

The TV Settings HAL acts as interface between the TV ControlSettings Thunder Plugin and Picture Quality drivers for handling various functionalities related to Picture Quality settings such as Brightness, Contrast, Hue, Saturation, Luminence, White Balance, Sharpness, Color Temperature, Backlight, Aspect Ratio etc., 
When the User wants to change the above settings with remote, The request is first sent to application and it navigates it as a curl request to TV manager Thunder plugin which then extracts the response and sends to TV Settings HAL.
This HAL will then sends the corresponding request to Picture Quality driver and do the necessary operation.
