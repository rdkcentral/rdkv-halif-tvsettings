## Description

TV Settings `HAL` is an interface which provides `APIs` to modify/control the picture quality parameters, dimming modes and auto backlight modes.

## Component Runtime Execution Requirements

### Initialization and Startup

The caller must initialize the `APIs` with picture quality modes for specific platforms and initiates communication with picture quality drivers. The standard/default values shall be maintained in default Picture profile database and any modified values for these parameters using TV Settings HAL APIs will be maintained in override Picture profile database. HAL shall be responsible to store these Picture profile data into the database.
Picture profile database will have 5 types of tables:
1. Picture property table to maintain all picture properties for a given picture mode, video format and video source
2. Picture mode association table maintain the association of a given video source and video format to a picture mode
3. If input source, picture mode, and video format are not already set or specified, they will default to "IP source," "Entertainment," and "SDR," respectively. However, if the caller attempts to change parameters that rely on these values, they will be acted upon default values accordingly.
4. White balance table for every color temperature and video source to maintain WB calibrated values
5. Gamma table for every color temperature to maintain the gamma calibrated values.
6. TMAX table for every local dimming level to maintain the TMAX value

- The capabilities of a specific platform with respect to TV picture configuration will be defined in a config file ([pq_capablities.ini](../../config/pq_capablities.ini "pq_capablities.ini")) which decides supported formats, picture modes, dimming modes, dvModes, resolution etc.
- Caller must initialize by calling `tvInit()` which must initialize the parameters in default picture property database. These parameters are decided by Soc vendor  based on platform capability.
- On every bootup the default picture profile database will be copied to override picture profile database.

### Threading Model

This interface is not required to be thread safe. 
There are no constraints on thread creation or signal handling. 

### Process Model

This interface is expected to support a single instantiation with a single process.

### Memory Model

The caller is responsible for allocating and cleaning up any memory used.

### Power Management Requirements

This interface is not required to participate in power management.

### Asynchronous Notification Model

This interface requires callback notification registration for VideoFormatChange, VideoResolutionChange, VideoFrameRateChange, VideoContentChange. The caller must return the callback context as fast as possible and will not block.

### Blocking calls

This interface is required to have no blocking calls.

### Internal Error Handling

All `APIs` must return error synchronously as return argument.

### Persistence Model

Each vendor needs to define their own config file which is expected to be stored in rootfs and this must be a readonly.
Config file must contain the supported formats, picture modes, dimming modes, dvModes, resolution etc.

## Non-functional requirements

Following non-functional requirement must be supported by the TV Settings `HAL` component:

### Logging and debugging requirements

This interface is required to support DEBUG, INFO and ERROR messages. DEBUG is required to be disabled by default and enabled when needed.

### Memory and performance requirements

This interface is required  to not cause excessive memory and `CPU` utilization.

### Quality Control

- This interface is required to perform static analysis, our preferred tool is Coverity.
- Have a zero-warning policy with regards to compiling. All warnings must be treated as errors.
- Use of memory analysis tools like Valgrind are encouraged to identify leaks/corruptions.
- `HAL` Tests will endeavour to create worst case scenarios to assist investigations.
- Copyright validation is required to be performed, e.g.: `Black duck`, `FossID`.
- Improvements by any party to the testing suite are required to be fed back.

### Licensing

This interface is expected to get released under the Apache License 2.0.

### Build Requirements

TV Settings `HAL` source code must build into a shared library and must be named as `libtvsettings-hal.so`.
  
### Variability Management

Any changes in the `APIs` must be reviewed and approved by component architects.

### Platform or Product Customization

Product or platform specification requirements will be handled in vendor specific config file.

## Interface API Documentation

`API` documentation will be provided by Doxygen which will be generated from the header file(s).
